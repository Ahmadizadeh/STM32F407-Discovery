# Understanding STM32F407 Discovery Board
The main purpose of this project is to get an insight into the STM32F407 Discovery Board, which is an ARM Cortex M4 based Microcontroller. As I started working on STM32F07 Discovery Board, initially it was difficult and confusing to understand and code this microcontroller because understanding internal structures and working of the microcontroller using datasheet of STM32F407VGT chipset is difficult especially if one is a beginner.

This project gives almost all the basic information needed to get started with STM32F407 Discovery Board and development of drivers for the same.
