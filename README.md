# Understanding STM32F407 Discovery Board
The main purpose of this project is to get an insight into the STM32F407 Discovery Board, which is an ARM Cortex M4 based Microcontroller. As I started working on STM32F07 Discovery Board, initially it was difficult and confusing to understand and program this microcontroller because understanding internal structures and working of the microcontroller using datasheet of STM32F407VGT chipset is difficult especially if one is a beginner.

This project gives almost all the basic information needed to get started with STM32F407 Discovery Board and also development of driver code.

Hardware Used : STM32F4 DISCOVERY kit, for more information visit https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f4discovery.html

Software Tool : Kiel MDK V5, for more information visit http://www2.keil.com/mdk5/. 
                For installation of Keil MDK V5 refer https://youtu.be/d_O2tu5CMbQ

Note: As this microcontroller has many advanced features and the main aim of this project is to get all basic insights, during the driver development only the required functionalities are added and other advanced functionality is not added. I may update the driver and other functionality in the future.
